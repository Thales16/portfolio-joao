# Dr. João Pedro Clazer - Professional Portfolio


## 📄 About The Project

This project is a high-performance **Landing Page** developed for **Dr. João Pedro Senczuk Clazer**, a Dental Surgeon specializing in **Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (CTBMF)** and Hospital Dentistry.

The goal was to create a digital presence that translates over 5,500 hours of clinical practice [cite: 11] into a sophisticated, secure, and modern visual experience. The design moves away from generic medical templates, adopting a "Dark Mode" aesthetic with fluid animations to reflect technical excellence and scientific precision.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Present the professional trajectory and academic background.
- Detail complex services such as Facial Trauma and Orthognathic Surgery.
- Provide a seamless user experience (UX) for patient contact and scheduling.
